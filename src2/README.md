# Improved source code subdirectory ([`src2/`](. "src2/ subdirectory")).

This directory contains a version of the R language compiler modified by University of Florida student 
Chris Clark for his senior project during the Fall semester of 2001.  The ([`docs/`](../docs "docs/ subdirectory"))
directory (parallel to this one) contains Chris' final report which describes the details of the changes made to the compiler.
