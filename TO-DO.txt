Things To Do on this project:

	[ ]  Rename R (to YaR or something?)

	[ ]  Review Chris's changes in detail, merge them into main src/.

	[ ]  Go through the entire compiler code, cleaning it up and fixing bugs.

	[ ]  Integrate some PendVM version into this repo (the original one, for historical reference?)

	[ ]  Create a wider variety of examples, more sophisticated test benches, etc.

	[ ]  Extend the language to support more sophisticated language features.
