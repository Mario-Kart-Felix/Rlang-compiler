# The R language compiler (`Rlang-compiler`).

This repository provides Common Lisp source code for the compiler (*Rcomp*) for the *R* reversible 
programming language.  Copyright (C)1997-2018 by Michael P. Frank.

## 1. Introduction.

R is a *reversible* programming language; that is, it is a high-level language for writing programs that can 
be executed in either the forward or the reverse time direction.  Such languages have a number of applications, 
such as for rolling back processes to synchronize concurrent systems, or for facilitating more energy-efficient 
hardware implementations of algorithms.  

Created in 1997 [1], R was historically one of the *earliest* reversible high-level languages, 
predated only by Lutz and Derby's Janus [2] in 1982, and Henry Baker's Psi-Lisp [3] in 1992.
Although R was actually developed independently of Janus, we ended up reinventing some of the 
same concepts.  

The syntax and semantics of R is vaguely C-like, but with a Lisp-like, parenthesis-heavy 
style of punctuation.  For more information, see the various documents contained in 
the [`docs/`](docs "docs/ subdirectory") subdirectory.

Please note that *R* is unrelated to the statistics language of the same name.  When our R was named, in 1997, 
the other one was not yet widely known.  Since then, the R statistics language has become very popular, so it
might be a good idea to rename the R reversible language at some point to avoid confusion.  One alternate name 
that I have used for it occasionally is "Ð¯R" (pronounced "yar"; the backwards R is Cyrillic "ya").  In ASCII 
this can be rendered "YaR" and taken to mean "Yet another R" or "Yet another Reversible (language)."

## 2. Requirements.

*Rcomp* is written in the [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp "CL wiki page") programming 
language, so running it requires a Common Lisp development environment (interpreter and/or compiler).  An example
environment of this sort that works well is [CLISP](https://clisp.sourceforge.io/ "CLISP SourceForge"), which is 
available on SourceForge, and also is an option in package distribution systems for common Unix-like environments, 
such as [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/ "CygWin home page").

## 3.  A quick tutorial.

With CLISP installed in your shell environment, `cd` to the `src2/` subdirectory of this repository's file hierarchy, and 
type `clisp`; you will see a welcome screen something like this:

      i i i i i i i       ooooo    o        ooooooo   ooooo   ooooo
      I I I I I I I      8     8   8           8     8     o  8    8
      I  \ `+' /  I      8         8           8     8        8    8
       \  `-+-'  /       8         8           8      ooooo   8oooo
        `-__|__-'        8         8           8           8  8
            |            8     o   8           8     o     8  8
      ------+------       ooooo    8oooooo  ooo8ooo   ooooo   8

Then load the *Rcomp* compiler by entering `(load "loader.lisp")`.

At this point, you can interactively enter a short program to compile:

    (myprint
        (rcomp
            '(  (defstring hi "Hello, world!")
                (defmain hello
                    (println hi))   )))
                    
This produces the following output in PAL (Pendulum Assembly Language).  (Which clearly needs to be more optimized.)
